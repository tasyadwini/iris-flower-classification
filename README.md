# Iris Flower Classification Using Decision Tree

## Project Description
This project is a machine learning classification task using the Decision Tree algorithm to classify different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
The dataset comes from the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The goal is to build a model that can predict the flower species based on these features.

## Technologies Used
List the tools and libraries used:
🐍 Python
📊 Pandas (for data manipulation)
🤖 Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)
📈 Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Model Training & Evaluation
The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().
A Decision Tree classifier was trained and achieved high accuracy.
The model was visualized using Matplotlib’s plot_tree(), showing how it makes decisions
